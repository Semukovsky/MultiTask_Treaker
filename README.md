how to use this programm:

import all libraries through pip install
do all commands through terminal
1) add: python main.py add '{what would you specifically need do}' '{in which category is this case}'
if you want to see the table, write: python main.py show
2) if you want to check the box of your chosen case (if you 'complete' any task) write: python main.py complete
and so on (find [typer.echno], and there will be the name of the team and what data you need to write next to it)
